## Repository Overview
This repository hosts the code for the **ATM Software** project. It follows a distributed development model where multiple developers can contribute by working on different branches and submitting pull requests.

## Setting Up the Project Locally
To start working with the project, follow these steps:

### 1\. Clone the Repository
You will need to clone this repository to your local machine to start working with the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ATM-Software.git
cd ATM-Software
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

If you're working with Java, C++, or Python, ensure you have the necessary development tools installed. Please refer to the specific instructions based on the programming language you are using.

Git Workflow for Developers
---------------------------

We follow a feature branching model where each new feature, bug fix, or change gets its own branch. Here's the workflow for contributing:

1.  **Create a New Branch** Before making any changes, create a new branch from the main branch. Name your branch according to the feature or fix you're working on.

bash

Copy

`git checkout -b feature-branch-name`

1.  **Make Changes** Now, make the necessary changes to the code. Ensure your changes are aligned with the project standards and well-documented.
2.  **Stage and Commit Your Changes** Once you're done with your changes, stage and commit them with a clear, descriptive message:

bash

Copy

`git add .
git commit -m "Implemented new login feature"`

1.  **Push Your Changes** After committing your changes locally, push your branch to GitHub:

bash

Copy

`git push origin feature-branch-name`

1.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** Once your changes are pushed, go to GitHub, and create a Pull Request to merge your feature branch into the main branch. Ensure you provide a detailed description of what you've changed, why, and any related issues.

Creating and Submitting a Pull Request
--------------------------------------

To create a Pull Request, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2.  Click on the Pull Requests tab.
3.  Click on the New Pull Request button.
4.  Select the branch you just pushed and create the PR against the main branch.
5.  Provide a meaningful title and description, and click Create Pull Request.

Best Practices
--------------

-   Use descriptive commit messages: Always write clear and concise commit messages that explain the changes you made.
-   Work in isolated branches: Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. This helps keep the codebase clean and reduces the risk of conflicts.
-   Write clean and well-documented code: Ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards, and include comments where necessary to explain the logic.
-   Test your changes: Always test your changes locally before pushing to GitHub to ensure that everything works as expected.
